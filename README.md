# REVIBE Training Hub

An internal employee training platform for **REVIBE** — upload training decks, view them as a polished slideshow, and track every trainee's progress, completion, and feedback.

Built with Next.js (App Router), Firebase, and Supabase.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📚 Training materials
- **Upload PDF & PPTX** decks via drag-and-drop (stored in Supabase Storage).
- **Google Slides friendly** — export as PDF for the best rendering + full progress tracking.
- **Auto text extraction** at upload time (up to 50 pages) powers full-text search.
- **Auto thumbnails** generated from page 1 of each PDF.
- **Category filters** generated dynamically from the uploaded library.
- **Dashboard search** across material names and embedded slide text.

### 🖥️ High-quality slide viewer
- **Crisp HiDPI / Retina rendering** via PDF.js (DPR-aware canvas).
- **Zoom, page navigation, and a page jump input.**
- **Slideshow autoplay** with configurable slide duration (3s / 5s / 10s).
- **Presentation mode** for full-screen, distraction-free viewing.
- **In-document search** (Ctrl+F) with match navigation and "X of Y" counter.
- **End-of-deck completion banner** with a clear finish cue.
- Legacy **PowerPoint Live** viewer retained as a fallback for older `.pptx` uploads.

### 📈 Progress tracking
- **Per-page view tracking** written to Firestore as the trainee moves through a deck.
- **Completion percentage** and completed/in-progress state per material.
- Powers the trainee's personal dashboard and the trainer's analytics.

### ⭐ Feedback & ratings
- **5-star rating + optional comment** collected per material.
- **Auto-prompted** when a trainee reaches the final slide.
- **Always-available Feedback button** in the viewer toolbar (trainees rate anytime; trainers can preview the form).
- Server-side validation of rating range and comment length via Firestore rules.

### 🏆 Gamification
- **Achievement badges** — multiple badges awarded for milestones (first step, completions, feedback, perfect scores, and more) with progress indicators.
- **Completion certificates** — printable / downloadable certificates for finished materials.
- **My Learning page** — personalized progress, in-progress vs. completed tabs, badges, and certificates.

### 👥 Roles & administration
- **Google Sign-In** (Firebase Auth) with automatic popup → redirect fallback.
- **Role-based access** — Trainer vs. Trainee, resolved from email + Firestore.
- **User management** (trainer only) — promote/demote users between roles.
- **Analytics dashboard** (trainer only) — platform metrics, popular materials, and a trainee leaderboard.
- **Annotation editor** (trainer only) — draw/text/shape overlays on PDF pages (Fabric.js), saved per page to Firestore.

### 🔒 Security
- **Firestore security rules** enforcing per-user ownership on progress and feedback, trainer-only writes on materials, and input validation.

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router, Turbopack) + React |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + a custom REVIBE design system (`app/globals.css`) |
| Auth | Firebase Authentication (Google) |
| Database | Firebase Firestore |
| File storage | Supabase Storage |
| PDF rendering | `pdfjs-dist` (pinned to `4.4.168`) |
| Annotation canvas | `fabric` |
| Fonts | Poppins, Inter, JetBrains Mono (via `next/font`) |

> ⚠️ **`pdfjs-dist` must stay at `4.4.168`.** Newer 6.x builds change the worker artifact and break CDN worker loading. Do not upgrade without testing.

## 🔐 Firestore collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Profiles + role (`trainee` / `trainer`) |
| `materials` | Deck metadata, page count, extracted text, storage URL |
| `annotations` | Per-page Fabric.js annotation JSON |
| `progress` | Per-user, per-material viewed pages + completion |
| `feedback` | Per-user, per-material rating + comment |

Deploy the rules with:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

- The web app deploys to **Vercel** (push to `main`).
- **Firestore security rules deploy separately** — run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` or paste `firestore.rules` into the Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules.
- Add your production domain to Firebase → Authentication → Authorized domains.

---

## 📌 Versioning

The current app version is shown as a pill next to the REVIBE logo in the navbar and is sourced from `package.json`. Bump it on each meaningful release so deployed builds are easy to identify.
